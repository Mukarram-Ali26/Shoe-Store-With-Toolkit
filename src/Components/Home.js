      <h2>How to Create the Perfect Homepage Introduction</h2>
      <p>Your homepage’s copy is a huge factor in how successful your homepage will be.
      It’s the first thing your visitors will see, and it can serve as a short “elevator pitch” letting the visitor know what your site is about.
      So your website introduction content absolutely needs to be compelling.
      Fortunately, writing effective homepage copy doesn’t need to be complicated. That’s why on this page, I’ll cover 11 tips you can use to design a page that’s interesting enough to make visitors want to learn more, and successful in driving them to take action.

      <h2> Be Concise</h2>
      <p>
        Your homepage has a few main jobs: Show visitors what they’re looking for, show them where to start, and establish your company’s credibility.

        Accomplishing this doesn’t need to involve a lot of copy.

        Of course, some products and services require more of an explanation than others. If your company’s core offerings are different from anything else on the market, you’ll need to do a bit more work to tell visitors what they are.

        But if you’re offering a product or service that your target audience is already familiar with, this doesn’t need to be the case.

        They’ll be able to get the basic idea within a few seconds. And from there, your goal should be to convince them that your business is the right choice for their needs and drive them to take action.

        If visitors immediately understand the site’s overarching goal, direct text is the best way to get them to take the next step.

        In fact, you should be able to accomplish everything you need in one to three sentences, as a general rule.

        Did you know that editing copy to be more scannable and concise can increase usability by 124 percent?

        When you think about it, that makes perfect sense.

        If the majority of your site’s visitors are scanning your content, some of them are bound to miss important information. They might read and remember the less-important details, but skip right over the copy that’s most effective in driving them to take action.

        When you keep your copy concise, you remove everything but the copy you want your readers to focus on.

        This way, you don’t have to worry about them getting distracted — because all they’ll see is your most important copy.

      <h2>Provoke Action</h2>
      <p>
        One of the most common reasons users leave a site is that they simply don’t know what to do.

        It’s not that they don’t want to become a customer — it’s that they don’t know how.

        This means that in addition to explaining what you’re offering, your homepage’s copy should also include a call to action.

        And it shouldn’t be an afterthought, either. Your call to action is the most important element on the page.

        After all, no matter how beautiful your design or compelling your copy, your homepage is useless if it doesn’t help you reach your business goals.

        Your site isn’t just meant to inspire a positive reaction — it’s supposed to help you drive sales and generate leads.

        And the best way to make this happen is to tell your visitors exactly what you want them to do.

        Take a look at how Southwest accomplishes this on their homepage:

        grab-attention-website-home-page-introduction-2-southwest

        As soon as a visitor lands on this page, they’re instructed to book a flight — and to do so within the timeframe of their current sale; in this case, by Monday. The entire page is designed around this action, and the clear directive leaves no room for confusion.

        Plus, the yellow “Book by Monday” button is a clear contrast with the page’s red background, making it immediately obvious where a user is supposed to click.

        Now, let’s a take a look at another great website introduction example from Memrise:

        grab-attention-website-home-page-introduction-2-memrise

        In this case, the call to action isn’t a button.

        This is a bit unusual and goes against what many marketers consider best practice for high-converting calls to action.

        But for Memrise, it works.</p>
      <h2>Place Your Headline Prominently</h2>
      <p>
        Beyond the copy you use in your main headline, it’s also important to consider placement.

        Your homepage has a limited amount of real estate for content, and your headline should take up a significant portion of that.

        Although you can include other elements, like photos and graphics, you want to make sure that visitors don’t miss your copy.

        So as you divide up your page, give your headline plenty of space.

        For example, check out how Slack balances their copy with a custom graphic:

        grab-attention-website-home-page-introduction-3-slack

        The graphic brings color and adds some visual interest to the page, but it doesn’t overpower the main headline.

        The 50-50 split layout, combined with the bold font used for “Where Work Happens,” ensures that visitors’ attention will still be drawn to the copy.

        Plus, the text has ample spacing around it to make it more distinct.
